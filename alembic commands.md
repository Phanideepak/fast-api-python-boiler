### **Alembic Commands in Detail**

Alembic is a lightweight database migration tool for SQLAlchemy, designed to handle schema changes in your database in an organized manner. It is typically used to manage database migrations for Python applications, especially with frameworks like **FastAPI** and **Django** when using SQLAlchemy as the ORM.

Below is a list of **common Alembic commands** and detailed explanations of their usage.

---

### **1. Initialize Alembic in a Project**

#### Command:
```bash
alembic init alembic
```

- **Explanation**: Initializes Alembic in your project.
  - This creates a directory called `alembic` in the project root.
  - The directory contains:
    - `alembic.ini`: Configuration file for Alembic.
    - `versions/`: Directory to store migration scripts.
  - This command also creates an `env.py` file that configures the connection to the database and other settings for migrations.

---

### **2. Create a Migration Script**

#### Command:
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"
```

- **Explanation**: Generates a new migration script by comparing the current state of your SQLAlchemy models with the state of the database.
  - `--autogenerate`: Automatically detects changes in the models and generates migration commands based on the difference between the database schema and your models.
  - `-m "message"`: The `-m` flag provides a short message describing the migration (e.g., `"Create user table"`).
  - This command creates a migration script in the `versions/` directory.

**Example Output**:
```python
# alembic/versions/<random_id>_initial_migration.py

"""Initial migration

Revision ID: abc123
Revises: 
Create Date: 2023-11-21 16:32:00.123456

"""
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

# Add your migration script code below
def upgrade():
    op.create_table('user',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('username', sa.String(length=255), nullable=False),
        sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint('id')
    )

def downgrade():
    op.drop_table('user')
```

---

### **3. Apply Migrations to the Database**

#### Command:
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

- **Explanation**: Applies migrations to the database by updating it to the most recent migration.
  - `head`: Refers to the latest migration script in the `versions/` folder.
  - This command will apply all pending migrations to the database, based on the most recent migration script.
  - Example: If you have multiple migration scripts, this command will apply them sequentially until the database is up-to-date.

---

### **4. Downgrade a Migration**

#### Command:
```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

- **Explanation**: Rolls back the most recent migration, effectively undoing the last change made to the database schema.
  - `-1`: Refers to downgrading one migration level back.
  - You can also downgrade to a specific revision by using its revision ID.
    ```bash
    alembic downgrade <revision_id>
    ```
  - Example: If you want to downgrade to a specific revision (e.g., `"abc123"`), use:
    ```bash
    alembic downgrade abc123
    ```

---

### **5. View the Current Migration State**

#### Command:
```bash
alembic current
```

- **Explanation**: Displays the current revision of the database schema, showing which migration was last applied.
  - The output will show the current revision ID.
  
**Example**:
```bash
Current revision for alembic: abc123
```

---

### **6. Show Migration History**

#### Command:
```bash
alembic history
```

- **Explanation**: Displays a history of all migration scripts that have been applied or are available in the project.
  - This will list all migration scripts, starting from the first to the most recent.
  - You can limit the number of revisions shown by using the `-n` flag.
    ```bash
    alembic history -n 5
    ```
    This will display the last 5 migration revisions.

---

### **7. List Pending Migrations**

#### Command:
```bash
alembic heads
```

- **Explanation**: Displays the latest (or "head") migrations that have not yet been applied to the database.
  - This is useful to identify migrations that are pending application.
  
**Example Output**:
```bash
Heads:
  abc123 (Initial migration)
```

---

### **8. View Migration Script Details**

#### Command:
```bash
alembic show <revision_id>
```

- **Explanation**: Displays details of a specific migration script, including the `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions.
  - `<revision_id>`: The ID of the migration you want to inspect.
  - This is helpful if you want to review a specific migration's contents.
  
**Example**:
```bash
alembic show abc123
```

---

### **9. Compare the Database with Models**

#### Command:
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Updated models"
```

- **Explanation**: Compares the current database schema with your SQLAlchemy models and generates a new migration script to reflect the changes.
  - This is useful when you update or add new models in your application, and you want Alembic to automatically detect and generate the necessary SQL statements for the migration.

---

### **10. Stamp the Database with a Specific Revision**

#### Command:
```bash
alembic stamp <revision_id>
```

- **Explanation**: "Stamps" the database with a specific revision without applying any migrations.
  - This is useful when you manually adjust the database schema or want to mark a specific migration as applied without actually executing it.
  - After stamping, Alembic will consider the database schema as having the given revision.

**Example**:
```bash
alembic stamp abc123
```

---

### **11. Generate SQL for Migrations**

#### Command:
```bash
alembic upgrade head --sql
```

- **Explanation**: Generates the SQL for the migration without actually applying it to the database.
  - `--sql`: Outputs the SQL commands that would be run if you were to apply the migration.
  - This is helpful for reviewing the SQL that will be executed or applying the migration to another database manually.

---

### **12. Check for Migration Conflicts**

#### Command:
```bash
alembic merge <revision_id1> <revision_id2> --message "Merged branches"
```

- **Explanation**: Merges two migration branches into one. This happens when there are multiple migration paths.
  - `<revision_id1>` and `<revision_id2>`: Revision IDs of the conflicting migrations.
  - This is used when two or more branches diverge in your migration history and need to be merged into a single revision.
  
**Example**:
```bash
alembic merge abc123 def456 --message "Merged branches"
```

---

### **13. Generate a Migration Script Manually**

#### Command:
```bash
alembic revision -m "manual migration"
```

- **Explanation**: Creates a new empty migration script where you can manually write the migration logic for complex or non-automatic migrations.
  - After this command, you will need to write your `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions manually in the generated script.

---

### **14. Alembic Configuration**

#### Command:
```bash
alembic config
```

- **Explanation**: Displays the Alembic configuration, which includes the database URL, migration paths, and other settings.
- You can modify the `alembic.ini` file for additional configuration.
