Testing are of three types -> Manual testing, Unit testing and Integration testing.

# Unit Testing
- Involves testing individual components or units of software in isolation from rest of application
-  Validates each unit of software performs as designed
- Unit = Test part of the application
- Developers write unit tests during development phase
-  Tests are automated and executing by test framework
- Benefit is to identify bugs early in development process

# Integration Testing
- Focuses on testing the interactions between different units or components of piece of software
- Scope is broader than unit testing, we are testing multiple units together
- Helps identify problem for entire solution
